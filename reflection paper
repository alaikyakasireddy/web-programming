At first i was pretty confused, whether i need to take this course or not. At first i thought to attend the class for 2-3 days and let me think after that, whether i need to take the course or not.
At the first day of the course, i really enjoyed the way prof.Todd McLeod teaching to the students and some videos which are inspiring to the students. so i decided to take this course.
Later he helped me a lot in go code, i really enjoyed doing assignments whenever i am free.The course has brought a great transition and now I am confident enough to write “Go Lang Developer” in my resume.
Ability to own a live website within seconds, wide use of flexbox styling, CSS and HTML, interaction with database and  Google cloud platform are the best of many things that this course taught me
Overall, it has been a great journey and a cherishing learning experience.
